# Black-Friday-Sales-Prediction
## Overview:
- In this project, we are going to predict the purchasing amount of customers during Black Friday, using various features such as age, gender, marital status.
- We will follow all the steps of a Data Science lifecycle from data collection to model deployment.

## Motivation:
- Predicting customer's behaviour is one of the most popular applications of Machine Learning in various fields like Finance, Sales, Marketing.
- Building such predictive models, we can predict the impact of the decisions taken on the growth of our organization.

## Conclusion:
- In this project, we tried to build a model using various algorithms such as Linear regression, KNN regression, Decision tree regression, Random forest and XGB regressor to get the best possible prediction.
- The hyperparameter tuned XGB regressor gives us the best rmse value and r2 score for this problem.
